# Welcome to My Research Page

## About Me
My name is Georgios Vasilopoulos and I am a researcher working in observational high-energy astrophysics and the study of accreting objects. My research focuses particularly in X-ray pulsars and Ultra-luminous X-ray systems. I obtained my Phd from TUM while working at MPE. Following my doctoral studies, I moved to New Haven while working at Yale University as a Postdoctoral associate for almost 3 years. I then moved to Strasbourg working as a postdoc and a member of the XMM-Newton SSC team and the « Galaxies, High Energy, Cosmology, Compact Objects & Stars » group. Since February 2023 I have moved back to Greece as I have been awarded funding through the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I) to conduct research (see Project ASTRAPE) at the University of Athens and in the Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications (IASA).
